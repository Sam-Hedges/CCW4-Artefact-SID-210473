My Uni submission for the below brief

## Brief
You will need to store varying personal information for each member in a structural manner.
To gather this information you will need to ask each member and store their answers in the following formats:

- their Name (string)
- their age (int)
- check if they are over 18!
- their chosen profession: (enum)
  Programmer, Designer, Artist or Audio
- their availability to work in person (bool)

To be polite you should always check if the user entered correct information after each question (Y/N - if answer is no let them go through that question again). Once everything has been answered present all of their answers for them to check for a last time (Y/N - if they say no start the entire questionnaire again).
Once all the data has been entered for the previous sections thank the user for their time and provide a prompt asking if another user should be added to the team (Y/N - if you enter N and there are less than 3 members the program should remind you that your team is not yet ready and provide the prompt again).

Your team must hold at least 3 members before it can be completed!
